                <p class="text-muted text-left">I am not such a great fan of football, but since there was no other sport that matched what I was looking for, I decided to opt for Football. Initially, I was very much ignored in the field as I was not so great in it. But, when I passed to 4th Grade, the tables turned. Suddenly, every captain wanted me to be a part of their respective team and become a goalkeeper. And no, this was not to encourage me, instead they had a feeling that I was a good goalkeeper, even though I was thinking the opposite. And since then, football has been one of my favorite sports.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">I used to dread swimming, while my friends considered it "fun time" rather than a sport. I still remember myself waiting anxiously for the bell to ring, so that I could get out. I did not have hydrophobia, but I never liked swimming. It was only after I visited Wonderla, that I started to like swimming and made some progress in learning to swim like my colleagues.

            <p>The mix of emotions you get during the entire duration of the debate tournament is simply amazing. One moment, you feel so scared, the next, you feel so confident. One moment, you feel so happy, the next you feel so devastated. Yet in the end, no matter the result, you always learn something after every debate!</p>

            <p>The captain was very tactful and confident. He was hopeful to turn the match in his favour. It was his confidence that instilled new hope and energy in the team. His team was again in high spirit. As a result it overturned the match and gained control over it which was lost during the mid-hour. In the meantime, the team scored a goal. The goal was appreciated with thunderous applause. The team was cheered by their supporters.</p>
